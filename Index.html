    <h2>Tommy's Greatest Achievements</h2>
    <p>Tommy graduated college at 22, which is normal. He got his driver's license at 36, which is... not. He never had much luck with the ladies, but he tried his best.</p>

  <section id="sports" class="story-section">
    <h2>Tommy the Spartan (For a Bit)</h2>
    <p>Tommy briefly played for the Spoto Spartans football team, but was removed after an incident involving cup-throwing at a gas station. Go Spartans!</p>

    <h2>Tommy’s Academic Journey</h2>
    <p>Let’s be honest... Tommy’s GPA barely existed. But hey — he showed up. That’s something, right?</p>
    <!-- GPA bar for comic effect -->
    <div class="bar-container">
      <div class="bar" style="width: 10%;">0.9 GPA</div>

  <section id="skills" class="story-section">
    <h2>Tommy’s Only Real Talent</h2>
    <p>If there's one thing Tommy could always do, it was carry heavy things. Boxes, couches, crates — you name it, he’ll lift it. Just don’t ask him to think too hard about it.</p>
    <!-- Drop a funny photo of him lifting stuff -->
