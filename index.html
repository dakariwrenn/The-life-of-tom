    <h2>Tommy's Greatest Achievements</h2>
    <p>Tommy graduated Spoto at 22, which is insane. He got his driver's license at 36, which is… not. He never had much luck with the ladies, but he tried his best.</p>

  <section id="sports" class="story-section">
    <h2>Tommy the Spartan (For a Bit)</h2>
    <p>Tommy briefly played for the Spoto Spartans football team, but was removed after an incident involving cup-throwing at a gas station. Go Spartans!</p>

    <h2>Tommy’s Academic Journey</h2>
    <p>Let’s be honest... Tommy’s GPA barely existed. But hey — he showed up. That’s something, right?</p>

    <h2>Tommy’s Only Real Talent</h2>
    <p>If there's one thing Tommy could always do, it was carry heavy things. Boxes, couches, crates — you name it, he’ll lift it. Just don’t ask him to think too hard about it.</p>
